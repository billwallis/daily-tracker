"""
Connect to and read events from an Outlook calendar.

This requires Outlook to be installed as a desktop application on the
device running this code, and for it to be toggled to the old version of
Outlook ("old" as at 2023-01-10).

This is powered by the appscript library which is super helpful, but
there are some features missing in Outlook on macOS that are available
in Outlook on Windows. For example, there is no "all-day" flag in the
macOS version, and recurring events only show the initial event but not
the subsequent ones.

The use of appscript has been adapted from:

- https://stackoverflow.com/a/62089384/8213085


Additional appscript usage has been determined from using the
ASTranslate tool, available at:

- https://sourceforge.net/projects/appscript/files/
