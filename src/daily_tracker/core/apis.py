"""
The API classes that all integration classes should inherit from.

This module categorises all objects as ``Input`` and ``Output`` objects:

- The ``Input`` objects have an ``on_event`` method which is called
  before the task input is requested from the user.
- The ``Output`` objects have a ``post_event`` method which is called
  after the task input has been received from the user.

The class hierarchy here is::

                +-------+
        +-------|  ABC  |--------+
        |       +-------+        |
        |           |            |
    +--------+  +-------+  +---------+
    | IInput |  |  API  |  | IOutput |
    +--------+  +-------+  +---------+
        |           |            |
        | +-------+ | +--------+ |
        +-| Input |-+-| Output |-+
          +-------+   +--------+

The backend will then only interact with the ``Input`` and ``Output``
type classes through the corresponding ``apis`` class property::

    >>> type(Input.apis), type(Output.apis)
    (<class 'dict'>, <class 'dict'>)
